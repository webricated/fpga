Ripple Carry Adder Logic Implementation and simulation in FPGA 

Aim: 

To develop the source code for Ripple Carry Adder by using VHDL/VERILOG and obtain the simulation, synthesis, 

place and route and implement into FPGA. 

Tools Required:

1. Desktop computer

2. FPGA ISE Design Suite

Algorithm: 

Step1: Specifications defined and design was initialized. 

Step2: Name of the entity and architecture was declared by using VHDL source code. 

Step3: Syntax was checked , debugged the errors and obtained the synthesis report. 

Step4: Output was verified by simulating the source code. 

Behavioral Modeling: 

library IEEE; 

use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL; 

use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_ARITH.ALL; 

use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED.ALL; 

entity fadd_behv is 

Port ( a : in std_logic; 

b : in std_logic; 

c : in std_logic; 

sum : out std_logic; 

carry : out std_logic); 

end fadd_behv; 

architecture Behavioral of fadd_behv is 

begin p1:process(a,b,c) 

variable r,s,t:std_logic; 

begin r:= a and b; 

s:= b and c; 

t:= c and a; 

sum<= a xor b xor c; 

carry<= r or s or t; 

end process p1; 

end Behavioral; 

Structural Modeling:

library IEEE;

use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_ARITH.ALL;

use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED.ALL;

entity rca is

 Port ( a : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);

 A(0) B(0) A(1) B(1) A(2) B(2) A(3) B(3)



S(0) S(1) S(2) S(3) 
Cin
 b : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
 c : in std_logic;
 s : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
 cout : out std_logic);
end rca;
architecture structural of rca is
component fadd_behv
port(a,b,c:in std_logic;
sum,carry:out std_logic);
end component;
signal c0,c1,c2:std_logic;
begin
f1:fadd_behv port map (a(0),b(0),c,s(0),c0);
f2:fadd_behv port map (a(1),b(1),c0,s(1),c1);
f3:fadd_behv port map (a(2),b(2),c1,s(2),c2);
f4:fadd_behv port map (a(3),b(3),c2,s(3),cout);
end structural;
Result: Ripple Carry Adder was implemented and the result was simulated in FPGA ISE Design
Suite.
